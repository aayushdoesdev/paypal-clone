## Project Description

This PayPal clone is a static website to showcase the designing ability with the help of Tailwind CSS and also show some of the features of Vue Js and to show the good code practices to make the code cleaner and readable.

## Features and Libraries used

1. Made a seperate component for Button which uses Props to define the content, it minimises the repetative work of making the same button many times and makes the code clean and easy to manage,
2. Made the site responsive for big and small screens so that the webpage can be used in many devices rather than only on pc.
3. Used Vue Icons for getting the icons.
4. Used Tailwind Css to design the website fast and get rid of making seperate files for css.
5. Broke the website into different sections to make the code clean, readable which is easier to make any changes in future
